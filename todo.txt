We got 

MA  = Middle at, time circle need to be in the middle. 
CA = Create At, circle needs to be created at this time in order to be in the middle in MA.
Unit = Divide your screen in 10 equals parts. 

We need {
  We are going to divide our screen in 10 parts, each one equal.
  Our goal will be in the 5 unit. 
  Our circles will be created in the 11 part. 
  So, in order to be in the middle, a circle need to move 6 units. 
  
  Then, we have a distance of 6, and our velocity goes from 1-6Units; Let's do maths.


  D = 6 Unit;
  V = 1 Unit;
  T = ???;

  MA = 1; 
  CA = MA - T;
  
  T = D / V;
  T = 6 / 1;
  T = 6; 

  CA = MA - T;
  CA = 1 - 6; 
  CA = -5;

  

  So, if our circle V if 1 Unit, we need to create 5 seconds before it's supposed to be in the middle. 


  D = 6 Unit;
  V = 2 Unit;
  T = ???;

  MA = 1; 
  CA = MA - T;
  
  T = D / V;
  T = 6 / 2;
  T = 3; 

  CA = MA - T;
  CA = 1 - 3; 
  CA = -2;

  So, if our circle V if 2 Unit, we need to create 3 seconds before it's supposed to be in the middle. 

  D = 6 Unit;
  V = 3 Unit;
  T = ???;

  MA = 1; 
  CA = MA - T;
  
  T = D / V;
  T = 6 / 3;
  T = 2; 

  CA = MA - T;
  CA = 1 - 2; 
  CA = -1;

  So, if our circle V if 2 Unit, we need to create 1 seconds before it's supposed to be in the middle. 

  D = 6 Unit;
  V = 4 Unit;
  T = ???;

  MA = 1; 
  CA = MA - T;
  
  T = D / V;
  T = 6 / 4;
  T = 1.5; 

  CA = MA - T;
  CA = 1 - 1.5; 
  CA = -0.5;

  So, if our circle V if 2 Unit, we need to create 1.5 seconds before it's supposed to be in the middle. 

  D = 6 Unit;
  V = 5 Unit;
  T = ???;

  MA = 1; 
  CA = MA - T;
  
  T = D / V;
  T = 6 / 5;
  T = 1.2; 

  CA = MA - T;
  CA = 1 - 1.2; 
  CA = -0.2;

  So, if our circle V if 2 Unit, we need to create 1.2 seconds before it's supposed to be in the middle. 

  D = 6 Unit;
  V = 6 Unit;
  T = ???;

  MA = 1; 
  CA = MA - T;
  
  T = D / V;
  T = 6 / 6;
  T = 1; 

  CA = MA - T;
  CA = 1 - 1; 
  CA = 0;

  So, if our circle V if 2 Unit, we need to create 1 seconds before it's supposed to be in the middle. 
  

  Then, we need to know, how much is a unit, so we are going to create this unit in our main page. 
  We are going to calc our D,V,T, & CA inside our main, and we are going to pass this as a props to our rows.
  
  to our rows. 

  D = 6 Unit;
  V = 6 Unit;
  T = ???;

  MA = 1; 
  CA = MA - T;
  
  T = D / V;
  T = 6 / 6;
  T = 1; 

  CA = MA - T;
  CA = 1 - 1; 
  CA = 0;
